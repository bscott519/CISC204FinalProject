What do you think about the theme of our game?
One of our testers said that the theme was nice and simple. They thought details like the blue sky,
clouds, and trees helped make the setting of the game fun to look at and play in.

What do you think about movement of the player and ease of controlling them?
One of our testers said that the movement of the bird was very smooth and easy to control. The birdâ€™s movement was very consistent 
and colliding with the pipes or ground worked as it should.
